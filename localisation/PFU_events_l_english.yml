Kamikazes are your biggest weapon in the naval war, use this and your air superiority in the region to your advantage, never fight in areas where you don't have air superiority. \n 5. Heavy fighters and tactical bombers are incredibly useful for Japan, not only as Kamikazes but as ground attack vehicles in the large airzones of Asia. \n 6.
